# Relio agent guidance

This file is the canonical entry point for automated contributors. More specific
instructions under `.github/instructions/` apply when they do not conflict with
this file or with the existing implementation.

## Product and architecture

- Relio is a private relationship memory system: people, interactions, notes,
  reminders and difficult moments. It is not a CRM, a social network or an AI
  advisor. See the epics in GitHub issues for the scope of the MVP.
- Relio is a .NET 10 Blazor Web App using Interactive Server rendering,
  MudBlazor, EF Core, SQL Server and ASP.NET Core Identity.
- Preserve the Domain / Application / Data / Web separation. Razor components
  orchestrate UI only; data access and business invariants belong in services.
- Every read, mutation and related-entity assignment must be scoped to the
  authenticated user. Validate both the primary entity and all supplied foreign IDs.
  There is no shared or team data in the MVP.
- Active views exclude archived people by default. Archive and restore must be
  reversible.
- Birthdays, reminder dates and interaction dates are user-calendar dates in the
  user's time zone; audit timestamps remain UTC.
- Relio runs both as a hosted service and self-hosted. Hosted-only features
  (billing, analytics) sit behind configuration flags that are off by default,
  and every feature must work with them off.

## Current product decisions

- MudBlazor is the only UI component framework.
- No AI features in the MVP.
- Tests use xUnit and AwesomeAssertions.

## Required validation

Run before handing off changes:

```bash
dotnet restore Relio.slnx
dotnet build Relio.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test Relio.slnx --configuration Release --no-build
dotnet list Relio.slnx package --vulnerable --include-transitive
git diff --check
```

Once the data layer exists, also run
`dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes --project Relio.Data --startup-project Relio.Web --no-build --configuration Release`.
