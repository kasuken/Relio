# Relio agent guidance

This file is the canonical entry point for automated contributors. More specific
instructions under `.github/instructions/` and `.github/skills/` apply when they
do not conflict with this file or with the existing implementation.

## Product and architecture

- Relio is a private relationship memory system: people, interactions, notes,
  reminders and difficult moments. It is not a CRM, a social network or an AI
  advisor. See the epics in GitHub issues for the scope of the MVP.
- Relio is a .NET 10 Blazor Web App using Interactive Server rendering,
  MudBlazor, EF Core, SQL Server and ASP.NET Core Identity.
- Preserve the Domain / Application / Data / Web separation. Razor components
  orchestrate UI only; data access and business invariants belong in services.
- Every read, mutation and related-entity assignment must be scoped to the
  authenticated user. Validate both the primary entity and all supplied foreign IDs.
  There is no shared or team data in the MVP.
- Active views exclude archived people by default. Archive and restore must be
  reversible.
- Birthdays, reminder dates and interaction dates are user-calendar dates in the
  user's time zone; audit timestamps remain UTC.
- Relio runs both as a hosted service and self-hosted. Hosted-only features
  (billing, analytics) sit behind configuration flags that are off by default,
  and every feature must work with them off.

## Current product decisions

- MudBlazor is the only UI component framework. All UI follows the design system in
  `docs/design-system/README.md`: use the theme and tokens, never hard-coded colours or fonts.
- No third-party requests from the app (fonts are self-hosted, no CDNs or analytics scripts).
- No AI features in the MVP.
- Tests use xUnit and AwesomeAssertions.

## User-scoped data pattern

Established by issue #10 and exercised end to end by `Person`/`Tag`/`IPeopleService`. Follow this
for every new owned entity and service; do not invent new plumbing per feature.

**Domain (`Relio.Domain`, no dependencies).**
- Every user-owned entity implements `IOwnedEntity` (`OwnerId`, `CreatedAtUtc`, `UpdatedAtUtc`),
  normally by inheriting the `OwnedEntity` base class. `OwnerId` matches the future ASP.NET Core
  Identity user id (epic #14); it is set once by the service that creates the entity, never by a
  caller or the database.
- Archivable entities add their own `IsArchived`/`ArchivedAtUtc`, following `Person`.

**Application (`Relio.Application`).**
- Read the signed-in user only through `ICurrentUser` (`Security/ICurrentUser.cs`) - never
  `HttpContext`. Call the `RequireUserId()` extension first in every service method; it throws
  `UnauthenticatedUserException` when nobody is signed in.
- Define one service interface per aggregate (e.g. `IPeopleService`) with request records for
  create/update input. Every method takes/returns only data already scoped to the current user.
- When a mutation accepts a foreign id (e.g. a tag id), the implementation must resolve it against
  rows owned by the current user and throw `Ownership.ForeignEntityNotOwnedException` if any id
  does not resolve. Not-found and not-owned use the exact same message - never let a request
  distinguish "doesn't exist" from "belongs to someone else".
- For the primary entity, not-found and not-owned are both reported as "no result": `GetAsync`
  returns `null`, `UpdateAsync`/`ArchiveAsync`/`RestoreAsync` return `false`. Never throw a
  not-found exception for the primary entity - it would leak existence through a different code
  path than the foreign-id case.

**Data (`Relio.Data`) - where the EF-dependent implementation lives.**
- Service *interfaces* live in `Relio.Application`; service *implementations* live in
  `Relio.Data` (e.g. `Relio.Data.People.PeopleService`) because they depend on `RelioDbContext`
  directly. This keeps Domain and Application free of EF Core while still satisfying "data access
  belongs in services". Register implementations in `AddRelioData` (`ServiceCollectionExtensions`).
- Ownership is enforced by **explicit filtering in every query and mutation**
  (`.Where(x => x.OwnerId == ownerId)`), not a global EF Core query filter. A global filter would
  need the `DbContext` itself to know the current user, which is riskier to get right with a
  scoped context (easy to forget to set it, easy to bypass with `IgnoreQueryFilters`) and harder to
  unit test in isolation. Explicit filtering keeps the ownership check visible at every call site.
- Add an index on `(OwnerId, <column>)` for every column a list, timeline or lookup filters or
  sorts by (see `PersonConfiguration`, `TagConfiguration`).
- Audit timestamps are stamped once, centrally, in `RelioDbContext.SaveChangesAsync`/`SaveChanges`
  from an injected `TimeProvider` - entities and services never set `CreatedAtUtc`/`UpdatedAtUtc`
  themselves. Inject `TimeProvider` (not `DateTime.UtcNow`) anywhere else a timestamp is needed
  (e.g. `ArchivedAtUtc`), so tests can supply a fake.
- After changing the model, add a migration:
  `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project Relio.Data --startup-project Relio.Web`.

**Web (`Relio.Web`).**
- The real `ICurrentUser` is `Relio.Web.Security.HttpContextCurrentUser`, reading the
  `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier` claim off `HttpContext` via `IHttpContextAccessor`. Registered in
  `Program.cs`. Until epic #14 lands, there is no Identity middleware populating that claim, so it
  resolves as unauthenticated - that's expected for now.

**Tests.**
- Prove cross-user isolation for every new service: create data as user A, then assert user B's
  service instance cannot read, list, update, archive, restore it, or attach user B's own
  foreign-id rows (tags, etc.) to user A's entity. See
  `Relio.Data.Tests/People/PeopleServiceOwnershipTests.cs` for the shape these tests should take.
- These tests use the EF Core InMemory provider with a fake `ICurrentUser` and `TimeProvider`,
  because local Docker is not available in this environment and InMemory is enough to exercise
  service-level ownership logic. The ef-core skill prefers SQL Server for EF Core tests
  (InMemory/SQLite don't prove constraints, indexes or SQL translation); issue #13 adds a
  SQL Server-backed integration test project that should re-prove this same scenario against a
  real database.
- Never log note or person content (see `.github/skills/gdpr-compliant/SKILL.md`); ownership
  exceptions and log messages here only ever reference ids and entity kinds.

## Required validation

Run before handing off changes:

```bash
dotnet restore Relio.slnx
dotnet build Relio.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test Relio.slnx --configuration Release --no-build
dotnet list Relio.slnx package --vulnerable --include-transitive
git diff --check
```

Once the data layer exists, also run
`dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes --project Relio.Data --startup-project Relio.Web --no-build --configuration Release`.
