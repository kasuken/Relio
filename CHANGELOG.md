All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Data layer: `RelioDbContext` (Relio.Data) with SQL Server via EF Core, the `AddRelioData` DI extension, a design-time factory for `dotnet ef`, and an initial migration. Migrations auto-apply on startup in Development only; production applies them with an explicit `dotnet ef database update`.
- `/health/ready` now checks database connectivity (tagged `ready`); `/health/live` stays process-only.
- CI: SQL Server service container, a `dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes` gate and a `dotnet ef database update` proof step.
- Relio design system: MudBlazor light and dark theme that follows the system setting, self-hosted Alegreya and Hanken Grotesk fonts, CSS tokens and the timeline thread styles.
- Initial .NET 10 Blazor solution with MudBlazor, health checks, CI, CodeQL and CLA workflows.
